# Simple Keylogger

## Overview
This repository contains a simple keylogger program created for educational purposes. The goal is to demonstrate how keyloggers work, their mechanics, and the ethical implications of their use. **Please note that this software should be used responsibly and only for legal and ethical purposes, such as personal research, learning, or security testing on systems you own or have explicit permission to monitor.**

## Key Features
- Logs keystrokes silently in the background.
- Saves keystrokes to a file for review.
- Lightweight and easy to understand for those learning how keyloggers function.

## Contents
- **`keylogger.py`**: The source code for the simple keylogger.
- **`keylog.txt`**: A sample log file generated by the keylogger.

## How It Works
The keylogger works by monitoring keyboard input on the system where it is installed. As keys are pressed, the program captures the input and stores it in a log file.

### Process Flow
1. The keylogger script runs in the background.
2. It hooks into the system to capture every keystroke.
3. Keystrokes are logged to a file (`keylog.txt` or similar), which can be reviewed later.

## Usage

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Python packages: `pynput` (you can install it via `pip install pynput`)

### Running the Keylogger
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Siddharth-31/simple-keylogger
